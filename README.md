* Council of the Gods excluding Poseidon 

Zeus: OMG Mortals. Everything they blame on Gods.

Athena: Odysseus isn't complaining. You were happy with his victory and sacrifce then but whatever.

Zeus: Pallas Athena how can you say that, Poseidon has him pinned down for blinding his son.

Athena: Well, if we're in agreement I will talk to Telemachus to find his father: Tell the Gods; he's coming home.

* Garden of Telmachus

Telemachus come stranger, have meat, then tell me how we can help.

Athena: You must be the son of Odysseus.

Telemachus: So they say.

Athena: No, you definitely are, But tell me...what is going on with these woowers? 

Telemachus: Don't think me rude but these wooers couldn't care less about the bones of those whose house they loot.
