## Athena and Telemachus


* BOOK I In a council of the Gods, Poseidon absent, Athena procureth an order for the restitution of Odysseus and appearing to his son Telemachus in human shape adviseth him to complain of the wooers before the council of the people and then go to Pylos and Sparta to inquire about his father.


Zeus: OMG Mortals. Everything they blame on Gods.

Athena: Odysseus isn't complaining. You were happy with his victory and sacrifce then but whatever.

Zeus: Pallas Athena how can you say that, Poseidon has him pinned down for blinding his son.

Athena: Well, if we're in agreement I will talk to Telemachus to find his father: Tell the Gods; he's coming home.

Garden of Telmachus

Telemachus come stranger, have meat, then tell me how we can help.

Athena: You must be the son of Odysseus.

Telemachus: So they say.

Athena: No, you definitely are, But tell me...what is going on with these woowers? 

Telemachus: Don't think me rude but these wooers couldn't care less about the bones of those whose house they loot.
But may I ask who you are.

Athena: I avow to be Mentes friend of your Fathers. As you can see I am here with a ships crew I came to see your father they said he what is with his people but looks like the cards are holding him up odysseus isn't dead he's a prisoner on a far off island but tell me are you really so tall you are definitely the son of Odysseus!

Telemachus: Yes I am my mother says they say I am same as you.

Athena: No you definitely are Penelope popped out a good one, LOL, but tell me what is going on with these wooers, nobody is bringing their own share.

Telemachus: we were rich but they we're not honorable after he odysseus was gone the guards must be keeping him away.

Athena: God help thee! You talk to those wooers in the morning and get them out and get a ship with your 20 best rowers. Calling all leather boys. (soto voce).

Telemachus: Don't go.

Athena: hold me no longer, that I am eager for the way. But whatsoever gift thine heart shall feel to give me when I am on my way back let it be mine to carry home bear from the stores a gift right goodly and it shall bring thee the worth thereof in return.

She spoke and departed the gray eyed Athena and like an eagle of the sea she flew away but in his spirit she planted might and courage and put him in mind of his father yet more than before and he felt it and was amazed for he deemed that it was a God and anon he went among the wooers, a god-like man.

Telemachus: to wooers: Sayest thou that this is the worst Hap that can be fall a man? Somebody will be king of the kingdom now that Odysseus is gone but for me, I will be the Lord of our house and all that great Odysseus gave me with his spear.
They gawk in amazement, He ponders the journey all night.

Telemachus summoning of the wooers in the morning:
You must leave!

Telemachus:

Athena:
