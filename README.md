* Zeus: Mortals blame everything on the Gods!

* Athena: Odysseus is not complaining. You were happy with his victory and sacrifce then but seem to have forgotten about that now.

* Zeus: Pallas Athena how can you say that, Poseidon has him pinned down for blinding his son.

* Athena: Well, if we're in agreement I will talk to Telemachus to find his father: Tell the Gods; he's coming home.

**Garden of Telmachus**

* Telemachus: Come stranger, have meat, then tell me how we can help.

* Athena: You must be the son of Odysseus.

* Telemachus: So they say.

* Athena: No, you definitely are, But tell me...what is going on with these woowers? 

* Telemachus: Don't think me rude but these wooers couldn't care less about the bones of those whose house they loot.
* But may I ask who you are.

* Athena: I avow to be Mentes friend of your Fathers. As you can see I am here with a ships crew I came to see your father they said he what is with his people but looks like the cards are holding him up odysseus isn't dead he's a prisoner on a far off island but tell me are you really so tall you are definitely the son of Odysseus!

* Telemachus: Yes I am my mother says they say I am, same as you.

* Athena: No you definitely are Penelope popped out a good one, LOL, but tell me what is going on with these wooers, nobody is bringing their own share.

* Telemachus: we were rich but they we're not honorable after he odysseus was gone the guards must be keeping him away.

* Athena: God help thee! You talk to those wooers in the morning and get them out and get a ship with your twenty best rowers. 

* Telemachus: Don't go.

* Athena: Hold me no longer, that I am eager for the way. But whatsoever gift thine heart shall feel to give me when I am on my way back let it be mine to carry home, bear from the stores a gift right goodly and it shall bring thee the worth thereof in return.

She spoke and departed the gray eyed Athena and like an eagle of the sea she flew away but in his spirit she planted might and courage and put him in mind of his father yet more than before and he felt it and was amazed for he deemed that it was a God and anon he went among the wooers, a god-like man.

* Telemachus: to wooers: Sayest thou that this is the worst Hap that can be fall a man? Somebody will be king of the kingdom now that Odysseus is gone but for me, I will be the Lord of our house and all that great Odysseus gave me with his spear.

They gawk in amazement, He ponders the journey all night.

**BOOK II**

Telemachus complains in vain and borrowing a ship goes secretly to Pylos by night and how he was there received.

Failing in an attempt to get the Ithicans to help him to assert his rights Telemachus departs for Pylus under the guidance of the goddess Athene, who is disguised as Mentor a friendly chief.

Telemachus summoning of the wooers in the morning:
* Telemachus: You must leave! Get out.

* Athena: Good job

**BOOK III**

Nestor entertains Telmachus at Pylos and tells him how the Greeks departed from Troy; and sends him for further information to Sparta.

Nestor, the aged king of Pylus receives them hospitably; and while he is banqueting his guests the supposed Mentor vanishes and it is recognized that he was the guardian goddess of the family of Odysseus. From Pylus, Telemachus sets out for Sparta, accompanied by the son of Nestor, Peisistratus.

Nestor is having a giant feast on Pylus just as the ships of Telemachus arrive, and Athena leads the way.

* Athena: Telemachus, thou needest not now be abashed, no not one whit. For to this very end dids't thou sail over the deep that thou mightest hear tidings of thy father, even where the earth closed over him, in what manner of death he met, but come now go straight to Nester tamer of horses. Let us learn what counsel he hath in the secret of his heart. And beseech him thyself that he may give unerring answer; and he will not lie to thee, for he is very wise.

The wise Telemachus answered saying:

* "Mentor, and how shall I go how shall I greet him? I who am untried in words of wisdom, moreover a young man may well be abashed to question an elder."

Then the goddess grey-eyed Athene spoke to him again:

* "Telemachus, thou shalt bethink thee of somewhat in thine breast and somwhat Gods will give thee to say, for thou methinks of all men, were not born and bred without the will of the Gods."

So spoke Pallas Athena and led the way quickly and he followed hard in the steps of the Goddess and they came to the gathering and the session of the men of Pylus. There was Nester seated with his sons, and round him his company making ready for the feast.

**BOOK IV**
