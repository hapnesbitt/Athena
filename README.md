# Athena
 The Musical


Council of the Gods excluding Poseidon 

Zeus: OMG Mortals. Everything they blame on Gods.

Athena: Odysseus isn't complaining. You were happy with his victory and sacrifce then but whatever.

Zeus: Pallas Athena how can you say that, Poseidon has him pinned down for blinding his son.

Athena: Well, if we're in agreement let I'll send Telemachus to get him, and the Gods know he's coming home.
